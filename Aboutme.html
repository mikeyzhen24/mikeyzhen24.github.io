                    Hello, My name is Michael Zhen. I am currently an part-time chasier at Mitoushi Sushi. I am learning software coding from my friend Eric.
                    I like to watch movies/tv shows and play League of Legends when I have free time. I enjoy a large variety of music especially music from the
                    80s and 90s. I dislike excercising because I don't like to sweat and I hate the heat.
